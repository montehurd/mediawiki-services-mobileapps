# mediawiki-services-mobileapps [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wikimedia/mediawiki-services-mobileapps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wikimedia/mediawiki-services-mobileapps)

MediaWiki Services in Node.js for Mobile Apps.
This service is a facade the mobile apps can use to improve runtime performance by
* bundling multiple requests,
* performing DOM manipulations once on the server instead of on the clients,
* avoiding downloading of DOM elements that are not displayed in the apps and therefore not needed,
* taking advantage of caching via RESTBase, and
* take advantage of streaming by being able to use WebView.loadUrl() instead of piping every page section by section over the JS bridge.

Furthermore this can also speed up development by
* combining the DOM manipulation code for both apps into a single service,
* simplifying DOM manipulation code by moving it to JavaScript,
* flattening the JSON structure, and
* simplifying code because now the apps can use WebView.loadUrl() instead of piping every page section by section over the JS bridge.

More improvements and more endpoints are possible. We could also consider using streaming on the service side. But I'll leave that as a later exercise.

Note: This is currently in early development and things are going to change without notice.

More information can be found on the [wiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team/RESTBase_services_for_apps).

## Getting Started

### Installation

First, clone the repository

```
git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/mediawiki/services/mobileapps
```

Install the dependencies

```
cd mobileapps
npm install
```

You are now ready to get to work!

* Inspect/modify/configure `app.js`
* Add routes by placing files in `routes/` (look at the files there for examples)

You can also read [the documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ServiceTemplateNode).

### Running the service

To start the server hosting the REST API, simply run (inside the repo's directory)

```
npm start
```

This starts an HTTP server listening on `localhost:6927`. There are a few
routes you may query (with a browser, or `curl` and friends):

Swagger spec:
* `http://localhost:6927/?spec`

Info:
* `http://localhost:6927/_info`

The main route you may query (with a browser, or `curl` and friends):
* `http://localhost:6927/{domain}/v1/page/mobile-sections/{title}`

Example:
* `http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/page/mobile-sections/Cat`

There is also a route for the mobile lite app:
* `http://localhost:6927/{domain}/v1/page/mobile-text/{title}`

And a route for definitions from Wiktionary:
* `http://localhost:6927/{language code}.wiktionary.org/v1/page/definition/{title}`

Example:
* `http://localhost:6927/en.wiktionary.org/v1/page/definition/present`

A list of language codes can be found [here](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:SiteMatrix).

Feed endpoints:
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/page/featured/2016/05/30
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/media/image/featured/2016/05/30
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/page/news
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/page/most-read/2016/05/30
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/page/random/title
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/onthisday/births/05/30
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/onthisday/deaths/05/30
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/onthisday/events/05/30
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/onthisday/selected/05/30
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/onthisday/holidays/05/30
* http://localhost:6927/en.wikipedia.org/v1/onthisday/all/05/30

Note that day and month need to be 2 digits to be accepted. 0-pad them if necessary.

### Tests

There is also a set of executable tests. To fire them up, simply run:

```
npm test
```

If you haven't changed anything in the code (and you have a working Internet
connection), you should see all the tests passing. As testing most of the code
is an important aspect of service development, there is also a bundled tool
reporting the percentage of code covered. Start it with:

After the first run http interactions should be cached in the `fixtures/`
folder. If you re-run the tests, they should use the cached fixtures and run
faster (and offline).

For getting fresh fixtures just remove the `fixtures` folder and re-run the
tests.

Here are some other options regarding http caching:

```
npm test # Run tests with cached http interactions (same as VCR_MODE=cache),
caches new requests. Should be a lot faster, also VCR_MODE=playback plays using
cached http interactions but goes to network for uncached ones (without caching
them).
VCR_MODE=record npm test # Run tests recording http interactions
```

See [sepia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sepia) for more documentation about
the http recording.

```
npm run-script coverage
```

If you're going to run the tests many times, you can record the external HTTP
interactions for running the tests faster:

### Troubleshooting

In a lot of cases when there is an issue with node it helps to recreate the
`node_modules` directory:

```
rm -r node_modules
npm install
```

This is highly recommended whenever dependencies change.

Go apps!
